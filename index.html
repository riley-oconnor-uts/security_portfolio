        <h2 id="Reflective-Statement"><a href="#Reflective-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Reflective Statement"></a>Reflective Statement</h2><h4 id="1-Engage-with-stakeholders-to-identify-a-problem"><a href="#1-Engage-with-stakeholders-to-identify-a-problem" class="headerlink" title="1. Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem"></a>1. Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</h4><p>There were a good handful of stakeholders I involved myself with in the course of the studio. Mostly these were guests of the facilitating staff and industry professionals, who introduced us to concepts, tools, and methods that we used in solving a problem, whether given by them or self-defined.</p>
<p>Any of the guests could be mentioned, Ruben gave us problems such as how to find something within a program when the element itself is never explicitly stated, this was solved through the process of program reverse engineering and, while I don’t consider myself skilled at it, I was able to solve this issue with a few of the challenges he provided.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re1callfunction.png" alt="From the reverse engineering demo/presentation"><br>Things like the presentations on web vulnerabilities and tools used in penetration testing served to engage us with stakeholders with a given problem and associate our topic with the business aspects, meaning we had to evaluate what the needs of the stakeholder were and what specifically they desired from the presentation and the details they requested.</p>
<p>Practical experience was valued above all else within this studio, so any involvement with stakeholders was generally involved a certain level of technical understanding to grasp how different elements could be used to leverage a system, demoing of exploits and explaining vulnerabilities was not only done by students, but by staff and guests as well, properly understanding what was being discussed, taking notes and replicating the findings were important in solving the issuing and furthering progress.</p>
<h4 id="2-Apply-design-thinking-or-systems-thinking-to-respond-to-a-defined-or-newly-identified-problem"><a href="#2-Apply-design-thinking-or-systems-thinking-to-respond-to-a-defined-or-newly-identified-problem" class="headerlink" title="2. Apply design thinking or systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem"></a>2. Apply design thinking or systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</h4><p>Research and understanding up a large portion of the time in offensive security, creativity, and proper research is needed to find a suitable method of penetrating a system. No implementation is the same and as such, it should be expected that each system has different methods of or mitigation towards intrusion.</p>
<p>Design thinking is one way of approaching the problem at hand and can be generally applied to the process of solving a given problem in a system. Using my work on Kioptrix3 I hope to show how I applied a Design Thinking style thought process to solving the issue of bypassing the login system on a system where I had no hints to produce the username/password.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-1.png" alt><br>As I had a defined problem I had not figure out how to solve it, the most obvious solution was to find the login, doing so would allow me to log in and further penetrate the system, however, there were no files or scripts running that stored the user’s login information within and therefore that solution was not possible. The next idea was to try some form of SQL injection, meaning I could skip finding the username/password and bypass the login by manipulating how the system handled database queries, there are a number of ways this can be done in a login prompt so I used some of the simple injection methods to get through, on testing these did not work so I had to try with another method. The method that worked was found through using provided resources to gain connection directly to the server’s web shell, allowing me to navigate the system freely without logging in, it was not the simplest solution and took me a few tests to get it working, but I successfully solved that problem within the system.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-2.png" alt><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-3.png" alt><br>In the second week I developed a problem statement to partially define the work I would be doing over the period of the studio, it went as such:<br><strong><em>With the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities older systems are increasingly more likely to be susceptible to potentially compromising attacks</em></strong><br>In working through multiple boxes I continued to find this claim to be true, obviously, this is because it is a very realistic and general statement, as a problem statement for the work I have completed it is suitable and I did not see the need to change it.</p>
<p>I don’t believe design thinking or systems thinking were big influencers on my work, but their process was natural to the solving of problems within any system, being supplementary to the overall goal of any vulnerable machine.</p>
<p>Just to mention, but of course design thinking was used in developing this website and solving the issues with setting it up and migrating it between static and generated static platforms, but that is external to the overall goal of the studio and is detailed in the week 1 and week 2 blog posts so I only see worth in mentioning it rather than detailing it explicitly.</p>
<h4 id="3-Apply-technical-skills-to-develop-model-and-or-evaluate-designs"><a href="#3-Apply-technical-skills-to-develop-model-and-or-evaluate-designs" class="headerlink" title="3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs"></a>3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate designs</h4><p>Starting with no prior experience, in the course of four weeks I built a foundation of offensive security skills and was able to obtain root access on six vulnerable machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web for Pentester</li>
<li>Deloittes Piper</li>
<li>Kioptrix1</li>
<li>Kioptrix3</li>
<li>PwnLab:init</li>
<li>Curling<br>Using my understanding of computer systems, vulnerabilities, research materials and provided tools I was able to evaluate systems for their flaws and solve the challenge set for each system. I used a standard process for the infiltration of each system, starting from analysing and enumerating the system for its points of access, followed by researching the potential ways I could take advantage of an entry point to escalate myself within the system followed by executing the attacks I thought might work and repeating the process. While this is a simplification of the process, it roughly describes how I, or any attacker, should escalate within a system.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/nmap.png" alt="Enumerate the system)"><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/cve.png" alt="Research infiltration methods"><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/compile.png" alt="Execute attack"><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/passwd.png" alt="Escalate privilege"><br>I used a good variety of tools, with each serving a particular purpose in executing my attack, whether it be nmap or dirbuster for the sake of enumerating a system, or Metasploit and ExploitDB to find exploits, I needed to learn and use a handful of programs, resources and packages to automate and assist me in gaining access to vulnerable machines.</p>
<p>Is my knowledge extensive, of course not, but I have built the fundamentals for working professionally in similar environments. Like anything, achieving good technical skills in security requires a solid understanding and a particular way of thinking, I’ve fostered this way of thinking about problems and experienced a good variety of situations to best characterise the types of vulnerabilities a system might have.</p>
<h4 id="4-Demonstrate-effective-collaboration-and-communication-skills"><a href="#4-Demonstrate-effective-collaboration-and-communication-skills" class="headerlink" title="4. Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills"></a>4. Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</h4><p>A consistent deliverable in all of the weeks was some level of presentation, meaning for students to present some form of findings in an understandable sense to students and staff of varying skill levels, I presented on a couple of topics, the BEEF tool, Flash vulnerabilities, and the open-day presentations. I would say I presented anywhere between well and adequately in my presentations, suffering slightly from timing restraints and not explaining in a business friendly manner. These tasks were mostly collaborative, working in groups of four to produce and present the work, I worked well with my group as we were familiar with each other, so I had no issues in that regard.</p>
<p>Sprint reflections within the student group and free-for-alls were an important part in gauging participation and progress among the student group, not really for the staff, but for the students. The reflections were slow due to most not holding to the timing requirements, but allowed everyone to understand each other’s progress together, by comparison, the free-for-alls were much better for in-depth discussion but did not provide the class-wide understanding.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/notes.jpg" alt><br>I worked considerably with other students to help solve problems or roadblocks found when completing vulnerable machines, more experienced students were a great help in showing new resources, some were tools, like CyberChef, while others were commands and options which I used a lot in enumerating systems, such as sudo -l.</p>
<p>I spoke a lot with Larry and Darsh to understand the requirements of each week, asking how things should be formatted, what resources are suitable and voicing my progress on tasks or opinion on topics. I did this to ensure I was staying on track and completing the tasks in an agreeable manner, the two gave extremely positive feedback and I took it to heart, modifying what I was doing in the case of the website, or utilising new things they had suggested in the case of week three’s vulnerable machines.</p>
<h4 id="5-Conduct-critical-self-peer-and-group-review-and-performance-evaluation"><a href="#5-Conduct-critical-self-peer-and-group-review-and-performance-evaluation" class="headerlink" title="5. Conduct critical self, peer and group review and performance evaluation"></a>5. Conduct critical self, peer and group review and performance evaluation</h4><p>I feel pretty good about everything at the end of the studio, I’ve mentioned this before, but I feel my goal was achieved early into the studio and my pace was incredibly fast, but I slowed down a lot after that as I tried more challenging things to further my learning. Also mentioned, but I felt very nervous starting the studio and was extremely pressured for at least the first two weeks, looking back at that I am now more comfortable with my work and rather proud of what I achieved.</p>
<p>I haven’t the slightest reasonable complaint about anyone from the studio, staff, students or guests, they were all extremely accommodating and helpful. Some of the people who started at similar levels to me showed much more competence than I have, maybe because they focused on different aspects or challenges than I did. There are plenty of students in the studio there were a few students I did not speak with, this is my fault and the only times I could see their progress was during the sprint reflections at the end of the week, of those I did speak with, everyone seemed to have made a lot of progress in the studio.</p>
<p>I have specific reflections on the individual sprints and tasks in each weekly post, these capture my opinions at the time well, I’ve had positive and negative thoughts on how I or my group performed in any given task, but I would claim we completed any required task to a good depth and showed a lot of positive growth between the first and final week.</p>
<p>The course itself was interesting and fun, it didn’t suit the design of the summer studio fully and suffered only the slightest from not properly explained deliverables, but these were rectified through discussion and evaluation of the contents over the course of each sprint, so that was normal and to be expected.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>What have I learned? Coming into this course I was rushed, unprepared and nervous beyond belief, I was trying to keep myself above the abundant amounts of content provided and fulfill the high standard I had set for myself. Did I achieve this? Undoubtedly, my goal at the beginning was not complex, I just wanted to try and get all the way into a system, I found within the first two weeks that doing so wasn’t nearly as difficult as I had envisioned it to be and quickly achieved my goal. I learned a lot, and after completing my goal I continued to learn, in less of a frenzy than before, I picked up a few new skills during this time and tried a few things that might have been a touch too difficult for me, but regardless I think I learned from them.</p>
<p>I don’t think I pushed myself nearly as hard as I could have, but I set a realistic goal and worked hard to get it done, I plan to work further on this in the long term and the push to learn this much as quick as I can has given me more momentum than I could have had any other way. What was most important to this was probably the large number of people who wholeheartedly wanted to help and shared their insights, methods, and knowledge with me, its been great.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>As the fourth week of the summer studio (25/2/19 - 3/3/19) this post and its accompanying post cover the work of the final deliverables, the contents of this post will likely be much shorter than the previous three posts on account of the contents being split between this post, a final reflection post on the studio and a formal report document (which will be detailed further).</p>
<p>Because it was the final week, the work we delivered should reflect the work we have put in over the course of the month and present a final product as tangible evidence of our efforts. To give a proof that was consistent between all of the students it was requested that we each produce a report on the breaking into a standard machine, starting from boot, with the ultimate goal being to obtain root access on the machine. The machines used for this were suggested to be from the active Hack the Box resources to remove the ability to use guides and as many hints as possible, this replicated, mostly, the experience of breaking into a real-world machine.</p>
<p>Further, an open-day was held on Friday of the fourth week (1/3/19) to showcase the work studio members produced during the month to interested parties, professionals, staff, and other students. This served as a wrap-up celebration for the studio and to promote the work that was put in. Students from all of the different studio topics hosted presentations and displays of their work in the designated rooms for their topic, allowing for anyone to roam between the different areas.</p>
<h2 id="Reverse-Engineering-Exercises"><a href="#Reverse-Engineering-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="Reverse Engineering Exercises"></a>Reverse Engineering Exercises</h2><p>A series of reverse engineering challenges were provided to us on Monday by Ruben, who presented on the topic that day. Of all the contents over the past four weeks, I would claim that this one had the highest learning curve and was the most difficult to understand. There were four challenges provided of increasing difficulty, I completed three of the challenges, but will only be detailing two of them to completion because I forgot to take notes on how to complete the third and could not replicate my steps. The resource hosting the challenges is at <a href="http://uts-cs.securitygrounds.org/reverse-engineering/0x00/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://uts-cs.securitygrounds.org/reverse-engineering/0x00/index.html</a>.</p>
<h4 id="0x01"><a href="#0x01" class="headerlink" title="0x01"></a>0x01</h4><p>This was the first reverse engineering challenge I ever attempted, it was easy to understand at a basic level. When the script provided was run it would output the following:</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re1output.png" alt><br>This wasn’t all too helpful in finding the flag that existed somewhere in the program but using Binary Ninja you could see the space in the memory this ASCII image was stored using Binary Ninja.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re1memorylincoln.png" alt><br>Binary Ninja allows for the traversal of program memory, looking through the list of functions I found the main function, which calls function1. In function1 it can be seen that there is an iterating loop that ends at the value 0x4, being iterated 0x1 every loop, and then calls function2.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re1callfunction.png" alt><br>Function2 is the final function and stores a string value, identifiable by the 0x0 byte at the end, once the hex is converted to character constant the flag string is revealed.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re1flag.png" alt><br>This challenge was simple and served to familiarise me with the layout and navigation of functions and memory.</p>
<h4 id="0x02"><a href="#0x02" class="headerlink" title="0x02"></a>0x02</h4><p>This challenge was a step up from the previous and required some trial and error to solve. There was no hint in the output of the file, but the title of the file hinted at the use of some variety of crypto technique in the process.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re2output.png" alt></p>
<p>Similarly to the previous challenge, I went straight to the main function, there was a string value, however, its output was not in ASCII, instead storing hex values and therefore not providing the proper flag yet.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re2cryptostring.png" alt></p>
<p>Further into the function, it can be seen that each character in the string value is XORed with the value “45” to produce the output since XOR is reversible inputting the same value a second time would produce the proper flag.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re2xorloop.png" alt></p>
<p>Some confusion came when attempting to XOR the string, using CyberChef I converted the string from hex and XORed using the key 0x45, however, the output did not come out in a human-readable way. After some testing, I figured the output was reversed in some way. If the input was entered per-line of the string value in reverse the output resulted in the flag.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re2flag.png" alt></p>
<h4 id="0x03"><a href="#0x03" class="headerlink" title="0x03"></a>0x03</h4><p>By far the most challenging of the programs I accessed. When run the program would output an application menu asking for an option, regardless of the option entered it would return a string stating a Meterpreter session had been opened.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re3output.png" alt><br>Looking at the program in Binary Ninja it could be seen that the application menu was taking and processing an input, the function that caught my eye was the decrypt_flag function, which was storing and moving a secret number value. Using gdb you could manipulate the function to produce the secret number value, which, once entered into the program, would spit out an encrypted version of the flag. I was not able to reproduce this.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/re3flag.png" alt><br>I did the third challenge with David, he was much better at understanding what was going on in the programs and his knowledge of C was the main point in obtaining the flag in the third challenge, I mostly offered cursory things, offering ideas and pointing out locations of different things.</p>
<p></p><h3>Learning</h3><br>Reverse engineering is really hard and requires a lot of knowledge of the fundamentals of any programming language and assembly, even though these were basic challenges they were very difficult for me to complete, even with the help of people who knew the C language. Even if this isn’t something I see myself doing I found the knowledge regarding assembly to be not only interesting but also useful in the understanding of a program. I don’t see myself doing something like this often, but it is worthwhile to have the experience and keep it at the back of my mind.<p></p>
<h2 id="Vulnerable-Machine"><a href="#Vulnerable-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Vulnerable Machine"></a>Vulnerable Machine</h2><p>I’ll just note some of my experiences with doing the vulnerable machine without noting any of the specifics as to how I obtained the flags or the commands I used. I obtained the user and root flags for the Hack the Box machine titled Curling, finding the solution took a fair while and, as with many things, seemed easy in retrospect despite the large amount of difficulty I had. I learned a few new things doing this machine, which should be noted in my report.</p>
<p>I chose to do Curling based on its difficulty score (easy) and the fact not many other people seemed to be doing it, I want to do a more challenging machine, but I am leaving that for my own spare time, without any constraints.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/curlingown.png" alt></p>
<h2 id="Open-day"><a href="#Open-day" class="headerlink" title="Open-day"></a>Open-day</h2><p>Friday (1/3/19) was the final day of the summer studio classes and served as a display of all the effort students had put in since the beginning of the month, there were a wide variety of subjects being presented on across different rooms in Building 11 of UTS starting at 1pm. I arrived at 10am to organise with my group and hang around to see what everyone had planned for the presentation time.</p>
<p>My group planned to present using a demo of the Deloittes box and show the functionality of BEEF, basically show some of the simpler things we had occupied ourselves with over the past four weeks. The range of topics we could show was rather limited because of the disclosure agreements that we had to abide by, limiting us from talking about Hack the Box boxes or the real-world pen-test. I had wanted to have slides, but doing so would mean we couldn’t show the demo without taking up too much time.</p>
<p>We set up in a corner of the room early in the day and had a bit of difficulty setting up the BEEF demo because Nick arrived barely before 1pm, causing the BEEF demo to be set up soon after 1:30pm. Everyone, from every group, was extremely energetic setting up and presenting, the mood was kept high, there was a mix between business style presentations and demos of boxes or tools. It was strange setting up as, though it felt very busy it was at the same time relaxed in some way.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the day, just as an opportunity to just relax and keep a good mood, but we didn’t stay very long and only presented a couple of times on account of some group members wanting to leave well in advance.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week4/sydney.jpg" alt></p>
<h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>It really has been a great experience to try all of these new things that I have never known to try, UTS just doesn’t offer subjects on the offensive security type subjects to the kind of practical level that the summer studio has. I know Darsh, Jai, Larry and Luke all put a lot of work into making this subject work and develop it and the experience has provided me an array of new skills and knowledge that I hope to develop some time in the future.</p>
<p>As for where to go from here, I plan to learn more in the future as a hobby endeavour starting with completing more active boxes, I don’t intend to go to B-Sides this year, but some time in the future I would like to indulge and participate in similar events for the sake of my own curiousity.</p>
<p>Basically, its been a whole lot of fun, I have learned far more than I had expected, achieved more than I had thought I would and want to keep trying.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This post covers the contents of what I learned and did in the third week of the security studio between Monday (18/2/19) and Sunday (24/2/19). In building on the previous week, which focused on breaking into a web app. The third week iterates on this by taking the skills refined in web penetration to obtain root access on a system, allowing for full privileged access to the system.</p>
<p>The deliverables for the week were twofold, first, to present on a tool for breaking into a system in groups, and secondly, to either pen-test a real-world case or obtain boot-to-root access on vulnerable machines. I chose the latter in this case due to comfort and obtained root access on Kioptrix 1, Kioptrix 1.2 and Piper with attempts made to obtain root on FristiLeaks 1.3 and PwnLab: init.</p>
<p>Ultimately I didn’t complete as many vulnerable machines as I had wanted and would like to have done more, but I could not due to time constraints, for the sake of documentation I will record what I did on each machine (except Piper) to illustrate my process and the issues I faced or what stopped me from progressing. Most of the content of the page will be regarding my experience with vulnerable machines as I believe it to be the most important and worthwhile content to document.</p>
<h2 id="Guest-Speakers"><a href="#Guest-Speakers" class="headerlink" title="Guest Speakers"></a>Guest Speakers</h2><p>On Wednesday (20/2/19) three industry professionals from Deloittes presented on the topic of practical red-teaming. My main take-away from their presentation was the practical thinking in regards to attempting system penetration and the tools they use to break physical security. Things like rubber duckies and RFID duplication (or things of the like) were tools I had not heard of before, seeing their designs and purposes was interesting from a hardware standpoint.</p>
<p>I think the occupation of red-teaming or similar jobs seem very difficult and stressful due to the skills required and tight time limits, but it is interesting nonetheless to hear stories from industry professionals about their methods and process. I don’t have any intention of making a foray into red-teaming as I don’t want to develop my skills in that direction, but I do enjoy hearing about the process and interesting stories from those that have experience, whether it be from conferences of casual conversation.</p>
<h2 id="Tool-Presentation"><a href="#Tool-Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Tool Presentation"></a>Tool Presentation</h2><p>This presentation consisted of finding, researching and presenting information on a tool used for breaking into machines, the presentation was 6-7 minutes in length with our group consisting of four members, one of whom could not make it for the presentation. The topic we chose was Beef, which is natively installed on Kali Linux, we chose this as our topic because the features provided by Beef seemed fun.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/group.jpg" alt="The presenting group"><br>Beef is a tool for executing a number of web attacks through the Beef client, which hosts a hook between a compromised host and the client. The range of attacks that can be executed depends on the host and the local attack database, the attacks range from malicious to mundane and are a lot of fun to play around with, we managed to set up hooks between our sessions and tested some of the features just to play around as well as managed to send phones calls to each other’s phones through Beef. The key requirement to get Beef hooked was to have a user execute a dynamically generated script (generally through some variety of XSS) which would act as the hooking agent for Beef.</p>
<p>Our presentation was split into four sections, how it works, what can be done with it, how it can be prevented and a live demonstration. I wrote the first section and introduced, I like to keep my presentations more slide focused, with the slides providing the main information while I provide more insights or auxiliary information to the topic. I likely spoke for the least time among my group, though that was very much planned as I expected the demonstration to take more time than expected, which it did. I feel I spoke on the topic well, but the core of my information was definitely from the slides rather than from my speaking, in terms of communicating information in a stakeholder friendly manner I was probably a little to technical on some aspects regarding the hooking mechanism.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/beefdemo.png" alt="A sample output we made from Beef using a laptop camera"><br>The most fun from this presentation was actually the research and usage of Beef, we didn’t take it all too seriously and more wanted to just have fun with what felt like a silly tool, that isn’t to say the tool can’t be used maliciously, but it definitely has an aspect of fun to its design and capabilities.</p>
<p>The presentations of other students were useful as I did end up using or at least exploring some of the tools other students mentioned, most notably CyberChef (n1474335 2019) which was presented as a general tool for all kinds of web features. I didn’t go too far into the app, but I did use it for base64 encoding and decoding.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/beef.png" alt="My presentation contents"></p>
<h2 id="Boot-to-Root"><a href="#Boot-to-Root" class="headerlink" title="Boot to Root"></a>Boot to Root</h2><p>These are all vulnerable machines from abatchy’s (2017) list of vulnerable virtual machines, I did not attempt all of them, choosing them at my leisure, though I did not want to do too many from the Kioptrix series. I was able to gain root access on three machines, two of which are detailed and attempted a total of five machines.</p>
<p>A lot of the details for how I explored each VM are similar because my process for enumeration and testing is rather simplistic, but I learned a couple of new tools over the process and implemented them as needed, they are detailed in the final section.</p>
<h4 id="Kioptrix1"><a href="#Kioptrix1" class="headerlink" title="Kioptrix1"></a>Kioptrix1</h4><p>This was the first VM I tried in the week and it was the easiest to gain root access on. My first step was to use netdiscover to find the IP of the target system and then I used nmap to check the running services and their associated ports. There were quite a number of open ports so I had quite a few avenues of attack to check.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k1-1.png" alt><br>There were no interesting pages to check with dirb, with the noteworthy ones being locked behind 403 errors.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k1-2.png" alt><br>As this was after learning about SSL’s heartbleed exploit I went straight to metasploit and targeted the server to see what would be returned after the execution of heartbleed. This worked and returned an email, but no password, meaning I did not gain any useful information.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k1-3.png" alt><br>When searching the particular version of SSL I found an old exploit called “OpenFuck” (Spabam 2003) that, when the architecture was specified, would use a buffer overflow to grant root access, unfortunately it was out of date, so with a bit more searching I found a guide to update it at <a href="https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/heltonWernik/OpenLuck</a> (Helton 2018). Once updated the code would not execute with my desired architecture, the guide said to use 0x6a, but on searching I found there was one for Debian and another for Ubuntu, using 0x6b worked.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k1-4.png" alt><br>The shell this produced had root privilege and I was able to execute commands.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k1-5.png" alt></p>
<h4 id="Kioptrix3"><a href="#Kioptrix3" class="headerlink" title="Kioptrix3"></a>Kioptrix3</h4><p>The steps to complete Kioptrix3 took a long time to do and was a hard VM to get root access. The ports reported open from nmap were 22 and 80, meaning I could SSH in and that there was a web server. The dirb for this IP returned a PHP admin page and a login page for something called Lotus CMS. In a post on the blog section of the website, there was a username for user loneferret, I noted this down. While there was a comments section I didn’t think an XSS attack would be useful.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-1.png" alt><br>Looking at Lotus CMS I noted that it was not an up to date version as newer versions of the CMS used a slightly more modern design, thinking this I searched metasploit and found a command execution script for Lotus CMS. When executed with the URI “/“ this gave me a CLI through meterpreter.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-2.png" alt><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-3.png" alt><br>My first thought was to explore the directory, however, meterpreter did not act like a normal CLI, so it took some adjusting. At the time my directory was /home/www/kioptrix3.com. I navigated to data/users/admin.dat which had the contents “<a href="mailto:|318d8dd409db395f0317efa71b3bad13e1fb9857|administrator|bla@bla.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">|318d8dd409db395f0317efa71b3bad13e1fb9857|administrator|bla@bla.com</a>“, this ended up not being used. Similarly, there was a salt in /data/config that I did not use or explore the uses for.</p>
<p>Under the gallery directory, I found a config file with the details for the SQL database root:fuckeyou. These did not work for Lotus CMS, but did for the PHP admin. This provided an interface to browse the database, which contained two sets of passwords, one for the local users loneferret and dreg, and another for host logins, which I assume were for logging in from particular hosts, such as loopback and root.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-4.png" alt><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-5.png" alt><br>Using a tool I had heard of earlier in the week, hashcat, I cracked the hashes and obtained the passwords for the two users.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-6.png" alt><br>These logins did not work for Lotus CMS and after a while, I remembered that SSH was open on port 22, which I used to SSH into the loneferret user with loneferret:starwars. Loneferret’s home directory had a shell script and a readme which stated to use sudo ht, when I did this an error was repeated, to fix this I had to issue the command TERM=xterm, which I guess enabled XTERM on the shell.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-7.png" alt><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-8.png" alt="XTerm was hard to get used to using Esc codes, had to Google a little bit"><br>Since I now had super-user privilege I figured I could edit the sudoers file, which would already contain a configuration for sudo ht. I added the root shell /bin/sh and tried to do the same for the web user, but couldn’t figure a use for it.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-9.png" alt><br>Issuing sudo /bin/sh gave me a root shell.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/k3-10.png" alt></p>
<h4 id="PwnLab"><a href="#PwnLab" class="headerlink" title="PwnLab"></a>PwnLab</h4><p>This was by far the most difficult machine I tried, this was due to the number of tools I needed to use that I was not acquainted with to progress through what felt like a very narrow process.</p>
<p>Obviously, the first thing I did was issue netdiscover to determine the target IP and then use nmap to view the open ports and their associated services.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/p-1.png" alt><br>The running services were Apache, RPC, and MySQL, on referencing these with ExploitDB I only found a single Apache exploit, but it did not offer any insight into the system. My next check was to use dirb, which returned directories at /server-status and /images, but I could not access either.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/p-2.png" alt><br>I did not know what to do next as there didn’t seem to be a vulnerability I could use or a webpage I could exploit excepting the fact the site used PHP to parse certain pages. On searching the internet for vulnerability analysis tools I found Nikto, which, when executed returned a page that could be used for storing basic configurations.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/p-3.png" alt><br>Attempting to access the page normally did not work, but one PHP exploit I found called “Local File Include” could be used through PHP to view local files that aren’t displayed client side. While the standard configurations for this did not work I went through a list on HighOn.Coffee (2016) of exploitation methods, with the third one allowing me access to the config file. The method itself involved converting the desired directory into Base64 to bypass the server’s filter and display the results in Base64.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/p-4.png" alt><br>The config page provided the login details and table name for the MySQL database, however, there was no login page on the web server. Attempting to use mysql on Kali showed that there was a package installed for CLI usage of a remote MySQL database, which when logged into provided me the usernames and passwords for three users. The package itself was somewhat confusing and not self-explanatory, taking me a little while to maneuver to the user table.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/p-5.png" alt><br>Once the password for user kent was decoded I logged in and was able to upload a file, the file itself was limited to an image file type and when a file with a false extension was uploaded it would also fail. I could not figure out how to bypass this and stopped attempting to access the system at this point. I would say I made reasonable progress and was not entirely disappointed in not being able to get root access.</p>
<h4 id="Fristi"><a href="#Fristi" class="headerlink" title="Fristi"></a>Fristi</h4><p>This VM was somewhat of a pain to complete due to the way the stages of penetration were designed to be somewhat unconventional and confusing, for me at least, I worked on the VM with Oliver. Due to my somehow breaking the VM and any other Fristi copy through some misconfiguration of the networking that I could not rectify I did not get any artefacts for the VM and could only get to uploading a reverse shell before the networking stopped working.</p>
<p>In this particular VM the IP address was already provided, so I went straight to determining the active ports, which returned port 80. On trying to access the index.html page there was nothing interesting to note, so we used Dirb to find any common directories on the site. The result of this was a robots.txt file providing the directory for three hidden directories named /coke, /sisi and /beer.</p>
<p>Through some creative thinking, Oliver figured Fristi was a drink and accessed a directory at /fristi, which lead to a login page. This following step was confusing for us and took a little while to figure out, we were provided a username, a long base64 string and an image encoded in base64. By my thinking, we might have to decode the image to find some hidden string or decode the long string to find the password as text, however, none of these worked.</p>
<p>After some searching, we found a tool to interpret base64 as images, using this we found the password, which was a long string of upper and lower case k’s, when entered into the login prompt with the username we were presented with an upload tool. The tool placed restrictions on file uploads such that only images could be uploaded, in retrospect, the best way to test this would have been to check the source code, however, we just tested different simple extension spoofing methods, with the simplest working. When a file was uploaded with a different extension it would upload the file regardless of the contents, the file I tried to upload was a PHP reverse shell.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week3/f-1.png" alt><br>Once I set up netcat as a listener I executed the code, however it did not work, this was likely due to the two networks being on different subnets, however I had no way of testing as, at that point, the VM stopped networking properly and I could not longer access or configure settings on the VM.</p>
<p>This VM was strange for me as it was the first machine I have looked at where the clues are hidden in strange places like within images or the directories following some pattern to find other pages and while these were strange at the time, it isn’t entirely outside of the realm of possibility that real sites have similar cases.</p>
<h2 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h2><p>There were two free-for-alls during the week, one on Monday and the second on Friday. On Monday I spoke with Mitchell who echoed a lot of my experiences with SQL injection and writing XSS exploits, though in retrospect things like this could easily be searched for online if I kept better track of resources. There is no telling whether I offered him any interesting information, but I probably babbled on for a little too long.</p>
<p>In Friday’s free-for-all I was speaking with Chris, David, and Max, or more listening than anything. They were talking about the boxes they had managed to get root access on while I listened along and took notes on their process, for the most part, they gave me help with the machines I was trying to break into, showing me the sudo -l command for viewing a user’s sudo commands as well as how to output to a dump file in Metasploit.</p>
<p>I really feel I should have done more vulnerable machines, or at least tried something more difficult, I don’t expect that I would be able to anything more difficult on account of not being able to do PwnLab, but the experience and frustration might be worth at least a little bit.</p>
<p>The work I produced this week feels less than that of the previous week, but the quality to how I presented it is definitely higher, with regards to my presentation this is probably not a result of improvement, but just a change in approach and attitude, being more prepared and having resources on hand to best present my content.</p>
<p>The most important thing I took out of this week is the breadth of new tools I found to help with investigating and penetrating a system, meaning my attempts to infiltrate a system have become less simple and a bit better thought out. By no means do I think my process is any faster, but without a doubt, I have spent less time hitting my head against individual aspects and focused more on finding as much as possible.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Over the past week spanning from 11/2/19 to 17/2/19 I have focused on the two deliverables requested for the week as well as refining the work I submitted in the previous week in response to feedback I was provided. I have changed the layout for this week’s post to better conform to the feedback and hopefully better organise the information on a per-task basis.</p>
<p>There were two main deliverables due this week, the research of bug bounties and responsible disclosure as well as a presentation and research on web-app vulnerabilities on an app of my choosing. Along with these I needed to practice my skills and understanding to help facilitate my research into the second task. While there is a reflection section at the end I am treating it as a general reflection while leaving task-specific reflections to their respective sections.</p>
<p>A problem statement should also have been developed with regards to the tasks this week, as something that should to some extent carry over into the remaining two sprints I have left it as a rather open-ended statement relating to the conclusion I came to in my research from this week.</p>
<p><strong><em>With the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities older systems are increasingly more likely to be susceptible to potentially compromising attacks</em></strong></p>
<p>In all likelihood I will iterate and improve this in my following posts, I hope that it isn’t too general and gives some insight into my thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="Website"><a href="#Website" class="headerlink" title="Website"></a>Website</h2><p>While a preliminary version of the static website was due on 10/2/19 the final submission of the site was 13/2/19 with feedback being provided by Larry and Darshil that day. While my submission was in the form of a static HTML site I have since updated it to use a static site generator and theme with a public site being hosted on GitHub.</p>
<p>The freedom for creativity through the generator, despite the more modern design is much harder for me due to the variable nature of all of the content types on the site, the limitation to this is my understanding of the theme and how the different files work together, I found the best way to understand this is through experience and testing different changes to see how elements on the public site are affected.</p>
<p>I faced a few issues in deploying content to GitHub through the generator, Hexo in this case, as I missed some lines of configuration and my relative paths were configured for the test site and not the public site.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/imageissue.png" alt="An issue with displaying images"><br>With regards to the root folder of the website the path to the private content was “~/source/themes/landscape/source/css/images/image” while the public path was “~/public/css/images/image”. This caused issues with displaying images as they would not display on the public site, by changing the path to “/securityportfolio/css/images/image” by testing different paths. Further, all content except the root index.html page would not work due to a few missed lines of configuration in the site’s root configuration. I found the solution to this by looking at the configuration files.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/missedline.png" alt="Some missed lines for Git config"></p>
<h2 id="Bandit-amp-Natas"><a href="#Bandit-amp-Natas" class="headerlink" title="Bandit &amp; Natas"></a>Bandit &amp; Natas</h2><p>I went through Bandit 10-30 and Natas 0-15 in preparation for the 2nd and 3rd weeks, at the time this was very difficult into the later challenges, so I will note the challenges I found either the most interesting or challenging from within the set of challenges I tried.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandit 12<br>I found this one to be kind of a pain due to its length and round-about nature, one thing I noted I should remember is to use the <em>file</em> command to determine the type.</li>
<li>Bandit 21<br>Learning about timed cron jobs was kind of fun, it was something I did not know and would not have thought to look at, so going somewhat deep into their scripts was slightly enjoyable.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/fun.png" alt="Fun and interesting"></li>
<li>Bandit 23<br>At this point I stopped enjoying cron jobs as I had no clue how to write something similar and achieve the methods that were required of me without referencing the work of other, the scripts themselves were easy to understand, but without reference, I would not have known what to do.</li>
<li><p>Bandit 28<br>Learning to use the <em>git log</em> command was rather educational and useful for the traversal of archived gits and using <em>checkout</em> was a nice addition in the following challenges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Natas 3<br>I just wanted to note this one for my memory’s sake as I think files like robots.txt should be something to remember due to their importance in many cases.</p>
</li>
<li>Natas 8<br>This challenge confused me slightly as the PHP commands could not be entered in the web terminal on Firefox as I would have thought and instead had to be initiated on the client terminal or CMD, which seemed strange.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/php.png" alt="For simpler PHP I also used an online tool"></li>
<li>Natas 11-13<br>These challenges were irritating as I required assistance again, the issue I had with these was the fact that the scripts required were long and confusing, with the exception of the XOR script, which was easy to understand, but not quite replicable by me. The best way to keep track of these and figure what to do would be to reverse engineer them, but at the same time, I am not extremely proficient in writing PHP scripts. Obviously, it is easy to understand how it is done in write-ups, but executing these myself feels much more difficult.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/how.png" alt="I understand it, but how did they figure it out"><br>Clearly, one of the large factors stopping my progress in these challenges is programming and searching for functions or methods to help with progress, but the only way to learn more is to try a larger range of challenges, this should be a long term goal past the outset of the summer studio.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="XSS-Research"><a href="#XSS-Research" class="headerlink" title="XSS Research"></a>XSS Research</h2><p>Luke Fuehrer presented on the topic of XSS attacks on web applications and the presence of scripting in most websites. as someone who is extremely fresh to topics like these I only knew the name, but not how they were classified and their interactions with the server, this was the most important point for me in understanding them. However, I struggled to understand DOM based attacks as my underlying knowledge of DOM is rather poor (even though I should know), that was really the only limitation to understanding the DOM attacks though.</p>
<p>While the presentation was meant to allow interaction with stakeholders as per the SLO I was only able to listen as I did not know what to ask and was only trying to follow along and take notes. In retrospect, I should have asked for a better definition of DOM, but I did not. Interacting with presenters and stakeholders is something I have continued to have issues with over the years as I focus more on understanding what is being talked about and taking notes rather than asking for clarification and professional questions.</p>
<p>Along with Luke’s presentation, students were tasked with finding a real-world case of one of the three XSS attacks being utilised in some way to exploit a system. A discussion was facilitated between groups of students detailing their findings. The time for this was somewhat low between starting research and ending discussion so the depth to which I could research was somewhat low.</p>
<p>The particular exploit I found pertained to the malicious injection of code into eBay listings through stored XSS in store listings by sellers on the site in 2017. The exploit utilised the fact that eBay did not prevent JavaScript from being placed into shop listings. Due to the fact that shop listings could be customised with text and script the attack used a JavaScript redirect to send users to a fake eBay login page where they would enter their login information and then be redirected to the real eBay page, allowing the attacker to obtain user’s login information and spread the script to additional accounts.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/ebayxss.png" alt="A copy of the script (Netcraft 2017)"><br>What is interesting about this attack is the techniques used to obfuscate the details of the attacks, the two key points made by Netcraft (2017) are the hiding of the redirect link in the script through multiple variables and the encoding of the webpage URL into base64 to hide the location. Besides these the attack was a very standard XSS attack with a somewhat simple goal, the fact it had not already been rectified by eBay may have been the most interesting aspect as XSS attacks are one of the most common types of attack and the vector of attack was a very accessible point in eBay’s application.</p>
<p>By the time discussion had begun, I did not think I was knowledgable enough to share my findings with other students and only discussed with those around me at the time while I read more into the details of the exploit. The person beside me, Oliver, also happened to research the same exploit as me, likely due to the fact it was well detailed and the third result on Google. He provided a lot more insight into the encoding that I have already mentioned and, where I had read into the method, he had clearly read more into the technical aspects, encoding and script of the attack. I don’t regret spending the discussion time researching, but learning about the exploits others found may have been educational.</p>
<h2 id="Bug-Bounties-and-Responsible-Disclosure"><a href="#Bug-Bounties-and-Responsible-Disclosure" class="headerlink" title="Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosure"></a>Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosure</h2><p>The first task we were designated to complete by 13/2/19 was the research on the benefits of ethical hacking and bug bounties and how we can use the skills learned in the week to respond to responsible disclosure plans. The word limit was between 300 and 500 words with my write-up below.</p>
<p>According to CVEDetails (2019), there were a total of 16,555 publicly recorded vulnerabilities found in 2018, having increased exponentially from previous years.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/cveperyear.png" alt="Number of reported CVEs per year"><br>The vast majority of these vulnerabilities focus around interfering with or gaining control of services on a system. Bug bounties are a form of crowd-sourced security testing offered by many large organisations and communities within the cybersecurity industry with the express purpose of encouraging the responsible disclosure of dangerous flaws before their impacts can be seen.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/cveperyear.png" alt="Number of reported CVEs by attack vector"><br>Responsible hacking through bug bounties is an effective way to minimise the costs of penetration testing and hiring of specialised staff by essentially contracting freelancers on a per-bug basis with payments as high as $250,000 for vulnerabilities in programs such as Microsoft Hyper-V (CRN 2018), where any slight bug could cost the company significantly.</p>
<p>In an industry where many experts are employed in contracted groups and less often to individual development teams (except in large organisations) bug bounties are a highly cost-efficient way of identifying possible entry points in both large and small scale products.</p>
<p>Responsible disclosure is a way to protect the reporter and developer when a bug or vulnerability is found. In the general sense, responsible disclosure policies permit the public to probe and test the security of programs and allow developers to respond to instances of reported bugs preemptively before issuing a notification to the general public.</p>
<p>A proper disclosure policy is important to encourage proactive testing of security formats on a system, companies such as Dropbox (Hackerone 2018) encourage such practices with a reasonably detailed disclosure policy and bounty program with well-defined bounds and scope to focus in on areas of concern for the company without disregarding the sensitive areas for users such as user details.</p>
<p><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/responsibledisclosure.png" alt="Every large company should have a disclosure policy (Microsoft 2019)"><br>Understanding a particular organisation’s responsible disclosure agreement anyone could test their in-scope items for any vulnerability given it does not break the agreement. However, this does not mean any site or organisation can be investigated for vulnerabilities while staying within legal grounds, proper research into the available domains and whether an organisation has an agreement is paramount to legally testing systems as an outsider.</p>
<h2 id="Web-Vulnerability-Research"><a href="#Web-Vulnerability-Research" class="headerlink" title="Web Vulnerability Research"></a>Web Vulnerability Research</h2><p>The task of researching and testing a web application was due for completion on Friday 15/2/19, my chosen web-app was “Web for Pentester” (PentesterLab 2019) by PentesterLab, as per approval by the supervisors. Going in I knew this would be an easy application to research the vulnerability of and I chose in on account of this ease, knowing it would be within my current skill. I set myself the goal of seeing exactly how deep into the connected systems I could get using publicly available methods and vulnerabilities. I had two VMs for this situation, one running the Web for Pentester web application locally and another with a provided VM of Kali Linux for all my penetration testing purposes, my limitations to this were to not interfere with the contents of the web-app VM except for verification of attacks.</p>
<p>The VM itself was designed to be very vulnerable from a web-app perspective, so I used one entry point as a method to infiltrate the rest of the system as far as I could, the particular issue I focused on was that of the unrestrained file upload, which is a serious issue for a server as anything can be uploaded and potentially executed.</p>
<p>My first step in finding vulnerabilities in the system was to understand the layout of the configuration, I did this by first mapping the publicly facing ports using nmap. Doing this showed me the versions of configured software, as it was not hidden. I referenced these software versions on CVEDetails (CVEDetails 2019) to ascertain what potential vulnerabilities I could attack on the system.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/cve.png" alt="High numbers do more damage"><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/nmap.png" alt="The nmap output"><br>The most vulnerable element of the provided was Apache 2.2.16, which had 27 vulnerabilities at the time with multiple different impacts, as my skill was low I looked for vulnerabilities with high impact and low complexity. The first I tried was a simple DOS using a vulnerability in how Apache handled the Range header with regards to overlapping byte values, as described in an <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/updated-mitigation-of-apache-range-header-dos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article by SpiderLabs</a> (SpiderLabs 2011), using a provided script I was able to replicate the attack somewhat.<br><img class="center" style="width:30%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/dos1.png"><img class="center" style="width:30%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/dos2.png"><br>On the Web for Pentester VM I looked at the network traffic using netstat before and during the attack, during the attack about 20 packets were coming in per second from my client. This didn’t seem very effective and I wasn’t too sure as to whether it was actually working, so I quickly gave up as I was seeing no results or change to CPU usage by the server.<br><img style="width:50%;display:inline;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/before.png"><img style="width:50%;display:inline;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/after.png"></p>
<p>My next avenue was to shift my attention towards attempting to gain root access on the machine, I did not have any method of achieving this so I mainly spent a lot of time researching. Using the file upload feature I uploaded a PHP script that would implement a <a href="https://github.com/artyuum/Simple-PHP-Web-Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rudimentary web shell</a> (artyuum 2018) for use on the web-app. Using this shell I could input simple one-line commands to investigate the system and check if my changes were properly implemented in the future.<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/cmd.png" alt="Sample terminal from the source Git"><br>I first attempted to usermod the web user to have root privilege, this was of course not allowed, so I then tried to brute force the password for the root user’s ssh configuration using Hydra and the “rockyou” wordlist. After 2 hours of waiting I figured it would take too long and gave up, it was later pointed out by David that the estimated time of 2220 hours was likely due to the wordlist I had used, though it might not have made much of a difference.</p>
<p>In testing I found I could, for whatever reason, use chmod to change the permissions of files owned by the web user and execute them, this was important as it would allow me to execute scripts for further attacks on the application. Using uname -r I was able to obtain the application’s version of Linux (2.6.32), which I used as a reference to find vulnerabilities on Google. There were two that stuck out to me, a vulnerability in the pipe.c function and an exploit called “Dirty Cow”. As shells already existed online I simply downloaded and tested the scripts on the application, at first I tried the pipe.c exploit, but I could neither understand it or execute it properly, as such I shifted my attention to the latter exploit.</p>
<p>Dirty Cow (CVE 2016-5195) is an exploit in Linux based systems between version 2.x and 4.83 abusing how mm/gup.c handled copy-on-write to write to read-only memory, allowing a user to elevate their privilege. I used <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a script authored by Firefart on exploit-db</a> (Firefart 2016) to do most of this for me, with the overall purpose being to write a new user to the /etc/passwd file that was read-only for the web user.</p>
<p>As the script was a .c file I had to compile it as a binary for execution, this had to specifically be in 32-bit as the target Linux system was a 32-bit system and did not support 64-bit binaries. Once that had been done I uploaded the script using the file upload on the web-app and executed the script using ./dirty password, which would replace the root user with one of a pre-configured username (which I did not change) and my desired password (password)<br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/compile.png" alt="The command to compile"><br>I could confirm the success of the script by viewing the /etc/passwd file, which showed my new user (firefart:password), I made sure the user had elevated privilege by first attempting to SSH into the user and then attempting to edit the /etc/passwd file, which worked.<br><strong>Please ignore the username, I didn’t think to change it.</strong><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/passwd.png" alt="Success of the script"><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/ssh.png" alt="SSH access"><br><img src="/securityportfolio/images/week2/edit.png" alt="/etc/passwd editing"><br>This was actually a lot of fun to do and took about 14 hours of work to research and execute, I tried a whole bunch of new things, most didn’t work, but was extremely excited when I finally had something to show for it. Until about the last hour I did not actually think anything would work and that the system was properly protected, but after a couple of tries I started to progress past the various hurdles in the way. All in all this was educational, exhausting and really nice to get done.</p>
<h2 id="Presentation"><a href="#Presentation" class="headerlink" title="Presentation"></a>Presentation</h2><p>I had a number of misunderstandings about the presentation that took place on 15/2/19 and ultimately performed in a way I would take to be sub-par. The presentation was a 2-3 minute presentation on the research and investigation of the chosen web vulnerability. As per the documentation, the presentation was to be about the vulnerability itself, the impacts upon the business running the app and the ways to mitigate the issue.</p>
<p>My misunderstanding came in the emphasis by Larry on the business implications of the vulnerability and the desired format of the presentation. I had prepared to present verbally on my topic focusing mainly on the technical aspects, ease, and implications of the attack, but failed to emphasise the damages to the business in my planning. Further, I had no concrete plan for visual aids in the presentation, however, I was given the impression on the day that visual aids were expected.</p>
<p>While I feel I spoke well and had good knowledge on my topic I failed in regards to the communication with stakeholders and only scratched the surface on the business impacts of the vulnerability. I also did not time myself and have no clue how long I spoke for, but I feel my speaking time was not nearly as much as I should have. Given another opportunity I would have liked to display the ease and impact of the issue in visual aids. In comparison, most other speakers had visual aids and spoke on the topic of general web vulnerability issues rather than ones specific instances in a designated web application, in this regards I felt my topic was better chosen.</p>
<h2 id="Feedback"><a href="#Feedback" class="headerlink" title="Feedback"></a>Feedback</h2><p>Feedback was provided on the Wednesday of this week pertaining to the website submission as well as face-to-face meetings with the supervisors relating to progress within the subject, as Darshil was the one who marked my first sprint submission he facilitated this. While my content was fine and was within the bounds of a pass one significant issue that was raised with my submission was the fact that it was in only HTML and did not use a generator to format content, as this was a misunderstanding as to the task requirements I have remedied it by the 2nd submission. As ever, speaking with Darshil was great for baselining the requirements of the week and the expectations that were needed for me.</p>
<p>I was extremely nervous about the expectations for the submission of the sprint and Darshil provided sources for a few resources into motivational speakers and imposter syndrome and assured me that I was within expectations. In regards to questions I had for Darshil and Larry I was able to assure that the web app I wanted to test on, Web for Pentester, from the provided resources, was suitable for the evidence of web app vulnerabilities. While I was worried about the depth to which I would have to penetrate the system I was told to do as much as I could to best display my learning and that I could use similar cases of scripts or attacks to apply to my research.</p>
<p>All in all the feedback alleviated a lot of my worries for the coming week and, while I was still worried, stopped me from feeling my efforts were fruitless.</p>
<h2 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h2><p>Over the week I worked more than 40 hours on the various goals and tasks, reading and preparation, but I barely scraped the surface of the content provided to us, such as Hack the Box and Mr. Robot as well as the WebGoat VM, this is because it took me too long to complete the basic tasks required of me and refine my previous work and understanding, I don’t think there is a way to mitigate this other than to either become faster or spend more time working, which may be unreasonable.</p>
<p>I definitely have to work on collaborating and communicating with not only supervisors and stakeholders but also other students, as they would be the best point of reference, my issue with this is that more often than not I am doing different things to them and cannot get a relevant input either because they are well ahead of me or I am doing something in a different field.</p>
<p>I understand the purpose of free-for-alls, scrums and communicating ideas and did find it interesting to learn how others had approached the tasks, specifically through the free-for-alls on Friday and the presentations, likely due to everyone already having completed their work and have fleshed out their ideas. I collaborated very little in sharing solutions to CTFs and such due to my incapability to complete them, but I did enjoy hearing other’s work in them and listening to how they solved particular challenges or their hints to others.</p>
<p>Following the first week it was very welcoming of everyone to come up to me and ask how I was doing or my interests to make sure I felt comforable and welcome. Coming into the next week I am hoping to take part in the real-world app test as it seems well within my capabilities and can provide a lot of insight into the application design of a system before the implementation of security measures, I don’t expect to find anything groundbreaking, but just want to have some fun breaking some well-trodden ground and get as deep into the system as I can.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I won’t worry nearly as much.</p>

        <h2 id="Engaging-Stakeholders"><a href="#Engaging-Stakeholders" class="headerlink" title="Engaging Stakeholders"></a>Engaging Stakeholders</h2><p>As the first week of the summer studio, my communication with the stakeholders, in the case of this project, Larry and Darshil, consisted of establishing an understanding of the expectations and tasks to be completed within the first sprint and the project as a whole. The tasks required to be completed, as per the stakeholder’s requests were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice with the CTF pre-work material provided</li>
<li>Joining the Microsoft Teams group for the studio</li>
<li>The formation of groups consisting of between 3-5 people</li>
<li>A 5-6 minute presentation educating on the topic of a particular security vulnerability or issue</li>
<li>A static website hosted online to host a portfolio</li>
<li>Journal entries presented as a portfolio relating to the SLOs</li>
</ol>
<p>As most of these points were thoroughly explained in the Teams wiki and discussion areas there was little consulting needed for most of the tasks with the exception of tasks relating to portfolio work and the expectations through the rest of the month.</p>
<p>As tasks that were very much self-defined, the website and end-goal of the studio required a reasonable amount of communication with the stakeholders to define the boundaries for the project.</p>
<p>With the static website, I spoke with Larry and Darshil to ascertain the type of content and format desired for the site and what resources might help with development. The feedback I received provided a long list of hosting solutions and layout tips as well as how I can detail the SLOs properly in each section.</p>
<p>I was uncertain what the skill level and expectations of the final submission were due to the difference in experience between all the other studio participants. On consultation with Larry I better understood the measure of success as defined by myself, how I should decide my goal in the final submission and generally challenge myself.</p>
<p>Below is a photograph of some of the notes I took over the course of the week.<br><img class="center" style="width:60%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/notebook.jpg"></p>
<p>Robert Mitchell, a security expert from Gitlab also presented on 6/2/19 and viewed the following group presentations. As someone much more experienced and professionally involved than me it was insightful to learn about the development of the scene and the impact of different vulnerabilities. It was also wonderful to have him participate in the group presentations as his genuine interest in the topics presented helped validate the effort I felt I put in and that our topic was not chosen incorrectly.</p>
<h2 id="Applying-Design-Thinking"><a href="#Applying-Design-Thinking" class="headerlink" title="Applying Design Thinking"></a>Applying Design Thinking</h2><p>I most obviously applied design thinking in the development of my static site for the hosting of my portfolio, the problem, in this case, was establishing a site online that can present my work in an appealing form.</p>
<p>For reference, the stages of design thinking are shown below.<br><img class="center" style="width:60%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/designthinking.jpg"></p>
<p>For the sake of ease I used myself as a reference point for the ease of use of my prototypes due to the small time frame between planning and deployment, one main goal I decided I needed was at least simple scalability for as wide a range of resolutions as I can within my capabilities.</p>
<p>I defined a few requirements I needed in the site, which I used in developing and iterating my design, the important requirements are noted below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scalable</li>
<li>Presentable</li>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Replicable</li>
<li>Organised</li>
</ul>
<p>While I would develop the whole site from scratch I used previous designs as the basis for solutions to my defined problems. In ideating I applied the same designs from websites I had made previously due to my familiarity and comfort with their designs, these were used as my base points for potential solutions to the design.</p>
<p>As I already had a design to base my site on I simply had to write the old design with updated elements that suited the requirements. There were two iterations of the design I used, reflected in the commits from my GitHub. While the first design was functional and organised I found it to be visually unappealing and updated the layout with the second design, which, while not perfect, was a considerable improvement to the first. Between designs I faced issues with scalability and elements I had never tried before like min-width and custom font faces. These were all simply fixed by referencing forums and help boards from people that had used those elements previously. Below is a comparison between my first design and second, clearly there is little difference in the overall layout, but the theme is much more appealing.</p>
<p><img style="width:50%;display:inline;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/oldwebsite.png"><img style="width:50%;display:inline;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/newwebsite.png"></p>
<p>Testing occurred between each small change in a webpage to make sure the layout did not break unexpectedly so as to conform with my requirement for replication, I fixed issues such as content overflow and minimum width through doing this and made the site look less broken at lower resolutions. One issue I could not fix was the slight disparity in the width of the wrapper between pages that have a scroll bar and those that do not, this is due to the use of percentage scaling based on the width of the window (not including the scroll bar), as such I had a design limitation of every page needing a scroll bar to maintain consistency.</p>
<p>With regards to security vulnerabilities, I conducted a fair amount of research into CVE 2018-4877, its function and applicability. As a vulnerability reliant on a poorly programmed function I determined the vulnerability could be used as a vector to conduct any number of attacks given only that there is an internet connection and the particular function can be invoked. Based on this it seemed only reasonable that so long as the vulnerable program could be initiated on the web then a payload could be delivered, leading me to the conclusion that web advertisements could be used as a vector of transmission. Of course, this was only speculation as the resources available regarding the vulnerability was limited and the only documented instance of an attack was through Microsoft Excel, however, the conclusion does not seem far fetched. Given access to the proper materials I would not mind attempting to replicate the attack under my hypothesis, however it is very much outside of my skill range.</p>
<p><img style="width:50%;display:inline;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/slide1.png"><img style="width:50%;display:inline;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/slide2.png"></p>
<h2 id="Applying-Technical-Skills"><a href="#Applying-Technical-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Applying Technical Skills"></a>Applying Technical Skills</h2><p>I enjoyed the experience of participating in the OWASP Juice Shop along with everyone else in the studio, as I have mentioned I am not confident in my technical skills, but I very much enjoyed focusing on particular areas and attempting to make progress into the restricted areas of the system.</p>
<p>I chose to attempt to break through to the complaints section of the webpage at api/complaints, while I did not succeed initially I learnt a lot about the tools I can use to investigate web-based vulnerabilities in REST methods and JWT tokens. This began as I wanted to submit a file with my complaint above the file size limit of 100KB, as I did not know how to do this I saw other students investigating the web requests using various tools, on consultation with Darshil and a bit of Googling I found Firefox’s web developer tools that allowed me to view the incoming and outgoing requests. When I sent a complaint via the complaints interface at /complain I found a POST request with the file api/Complaints.</p>
<p><img class="center" style="width:60%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/apicomplaints.png"></p>
<p>On attempting to access that webpage I received a 401 error mentioning a lack of Authorization header, which did not exist in the request. I happened upon a copy of the header in whoami requests from accessing the homepage and attempted to copy and paste the header into the failed 401 request.</p>
<p><img class="center" style="width:50%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/authorization.png"></p>
<p>This returned a code 200 with no apparent changes to the webpage. Darshil pointed out that I could copy the request as a cURL and enter it into my terminal for different results. Upon doing this I was greeted by the details stored on the webpage, specifically the {id, message, file, createdAt, UserId} fields for each submitted message.</p>
<p><img class="center" style="width:100%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/success.png"></p>
<p>As an aside, another student noted that the key in the Authorization header was encoded in Base64 and upon decoding I found the details of the key and the JWT configuration.</p>
<p><img class="center" style="width:60%;" src="/securityportfolio/images/week1/jwt.png"></p>
<p>One attempt I made at trying to access the complaints API was through modifying the key to allow me access, through Googling I found that the token could be set to none to essentially access an area without a JWT token, however my attempts to follow the details did not work and refused me access to the API.</p>
<p>Given this knowledge and awareness of the other API pages on the site I should be able to access and view the data on those APIs using the same method as I first described.</p>
<h2 id="Collaboration"><a href="#Collaboration" class="headerlink" title="Collaboration"></a>Collaboration</h2><p>We were tasked with presenting information on a security vulnerability with the rest of the studio on the Wednesday of the first week, my group chose to present on an Adobe Flash vulnerability from 2018. I emphasised the technical design of an attack and the feasibility of attacks using this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Our research was easy and each person was left to learn on their own about the vulnerability and help each other understand. One thing we had difficulty understanding was the exact nature of how the dangling pointer used in the vulnerability was created as no source properly detailed it. We did not divide up tasks or speaking and simply collaborated within the lab and on Discord to get the task done, leaving speaking order to the last task.</p>
<p>Five minutes were provided in total for all four speakers to present on the topic, this felt very constrained, but meant I had to focus on the key points, avoiding wasting time. Overall I would claim to have presented well despite my nerves, but I missed out a fair few points I wished to speak on. In feedback from Larry I was praised for my apparent confidence and understanding of the topic, which I could agree upon, however I would like to have done better.</p>
<p>I only used Teams to communicate in our group team as I had no queries and regularly kept updated with the chat going on and updates to the wiki, tasks and schedule.</p>
<p>The ending weekly sprint meeting allowed me to baseline the knowledge and expectations of the other students, reaffirming that I was not expecting the wrong things and learn more about the other students. While I didn’t have much to offer as it was the first sprint I figure I should think more about what to provide during sprint meetings more in advance.</p>
<h2 id="Reflection"><a href="#Reflection" class="headerlink" title="Reflection"></a>Reflection</h2><p>While I attempted many things through the Juice Shop and CTFs I feel lacking in speed and capability, of course, there have been notable improvements and given another week I am certain I could make much better progress in either of the mentioned tools, but for now I have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>I should definitely set myself a goal, some level to reach on any CTF or a particular difficulty or number of challenges to complete in the Juice Shop, however as a settling period I definitely took too long to adjust to the type of work required.</p>
