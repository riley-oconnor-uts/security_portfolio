<p>I have divided the site into pages based upon the week in which the task was due starting with Week 1 (4/2/19) and ending with the 4th week (1/3/19), each page consists of five elements reflecting the five subject learning outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem</li>
<li>Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem</li>
<li>Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design</li>
<li>Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills</li>
<li>Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation</li>
</ol>
<p>Each learning outcome can be skipped to using the list at the top of each page, further, the group and individual reflection files are linked at the top of each page, their details are re-iterated and better detailed in each week’s page.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>I am a third year student in my last semester of study in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology majoring in Applications and Internetworks. I requested to take part in the summer studio due to most of my classes involving networking and systems security, which I have developed an interest in over the past few years.</p>
<p>My technical skills are rather lackluster with most of my experience being the baseline of the security based subjects I have completed as well as some software tinkering with brute-forcing the private keys on insecure Nintendo 3DS firmware to install custom firmware, which isn’t all that impressive considering the process is already well documented and accessible to beginners. I don’t believe any of this is suitable enough to prove my capability in the security field and wish to develop my abilities through challenging myself in this boot camp.</p>
<p>As this is something I enjoy as a hobby and can fiddle around with to my curiosity along with learning more about the process and thinking regarding intrusion I wholeheartedly just want to have some fun and achieve something I haven’t before, which is wonderful thanks to having people that are more knowledgeable and capable than me on hand to field any of my queries.</p>
<h2 id="Learning-Contract"><a href="#Learning-Contract" class="headerlink" title="Learning Contract"></a>Learning Contract</h2><p>As mentioned I want to develop my skills through this project, I haven’t thought much into particular milestones towards this and seek, for the most part, a sense of achievement that I have accomplished something that I would not have been able to do a month prior. Of course, this is rather abstract and I plan to revise this section later to better reflect concrete goals.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be much better at research than practical tasks, but I am trying to push myself past my discomfort in this subject, and expect that in my group of four I can best help with exploration and documentation of any processes used. While I don’t expect to be very good at any scripting or high-difficulty exploits I can certainly attempt my best to research and replicate the processes of others.</p>
